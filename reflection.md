# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
For this milestone I implemented unique pointers instead of using vectors which is what I was using in our following
milestone. I created the LaunchProjectile() and LaunchProjectiles() functions to allow the opponent and pplayer to 
launch their projectiles. The unique pointers made the code more concise and convenient when I was setting the
positions of the projectiles.

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
I encountered quite a few challenges during this milestone. I struggle a lot with pointers but this milestone helped me
understand it a lot better. I also struggled with the graphic drawings because sometimes they wouldn't show up but it
was manageable. Sometimes my logic was off so it would throw off parts of the project but I was able to get through it.

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
The most important thing I learned during this milestone were pointers and making unique pointers. Before this 
milestone I didn't fully understand how they worked but this make it a lot easier to understand. They even became 
helpful.
